    reasoning: |
      - Clear diagnosis of "maligne melanoom" (malignant melanoma) establishes this as a primary melanoma case
      - No indication this is a revised report or second opinion
      - Report doesn't mention multiple primary melanomas (only describes one lesion)
      - Not an in situ melanoma since there's dermal invasion (Breslow 3mm)
      - Breslow thickness explicitly reported as 3 mm in the conclusion
      - Ulceration is explicitly mentioned in both conclusion and microscopy
      - Location clearly specified as left upper arm ("bovenarm links")
      - Subtype identified as "spoelcellig" (spindle cell melanoma)
      - Microsatellites not present ("Geen satellitose")
      - Mitotic activity clearly described ("meer dan 1 mitose per vierkante millimeter")
      - Mitosis count could be recorded as >1/mm² but exact count not provided
      - Lymphatic invasion not present ("Geen angio-invasieve groei")
      - Specimen is an excision ("huidexcisie") though not explicitly labeled as such
      - Sentinel node procedure recommended but not yet performed (no SLNB results)
      - No SLNB tumor burden reported since biopsy wasn't performed yet
      - All findings are consistent: spindle cell morphology, ulceration, high mitotic rate, and positive deep margin all support malignant diagnosis

    reasoning: |
      - The report clearly states there's insufficient evidence for melanoma ("onvoldoende argumenten voor melanoom") and gives a SAMPUS diagnosis instead
      - There's no mention of this being a revised report or second opinion
      - Multiple primary melanomas aren't mentioned or relevant for this non-melanoma case
      - In situ status isn't applicable since this isn't melanoma
      - Breslow thickness isn't measured or reported for SAMPUS lesions
      - Ulceration isn't described in the report for this non-melanoma case
      - While the location is noted as right thigh ("rechterbovenbeen"), we don't record this as it's not melanoma
      - No melanoma subtype is applicable for SAMPUS diagnosis
      - Microsatellites aren't mentioned in the histological description
      - The report explicitly states no dermal mitoses are seen ("Dermale mitosen worden niet gezien")
      - Mitosis count isn't applicable when no mitoses are described
      - Lymphatic invasion isn't mentioned in the report
      - The specimen type isn't explicitly stated (though it's likely an excision based on context)
      - Sentinel lymph node biopsy isn't relevant for this non-melanoma case
      - Tumor burden measurement doesn't apply without SLNB being performed
      - The diagnosis is internally consistent: mild atypia, no dermal mitoses, partial PRAME positivity, and negative TERT promoter mutation all support SAMPUS

      - The report describes metastatic melanoma in lymph nodes, not a primary lesion
      - No indication this is a revised report or addendum
      - Multiple primary melanoma status cannot be determined from this metastatic report
      - In situ component isn't applicable for metastatic lesions
      - Breslow thickness only applies to primary tumors which aren't described here
      - Ulceration status would apply to primary tumor which isn't mentioned
      - Primary tumor location isn't specified in this nodal metastasis report
      - Subtype shows mixed features ("deels epitheloïd, deels spoelcellig"), but should be not specified because not primary melanoma
      - Microsatellites aren't mentioned in this metastatic context
      - Mitotic activity isn't described
      - Mitotic activity isn't quantified
      - Lymphatic invasion isn't applicable for intranodal metastases
      - Specimen is clearly an axillary lymph node dissection ("Okselklierdissectie")
      - One large lymph node contains metastasis (1/20 nodes positive)
      - Massive tumor burden with 8.5 cm metastatic focus
      - No issues detected, pigment (melanin) visible in tumor cells supports melanoma diagnosis
